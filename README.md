# image-denoising-autoencoder
mage Denoising Autoencoder is a deep learning project that leverages Convolutional Autoencoders (CNN-based Autoencoders) to remove noise from images while retaining essential visual details.

The model is trained by adding random Gaussian noise to clean images and then learning to reconstruct the original noise-free version. This approach allows the autoencoder to act as a robust denoising filter, effectively enhancing image quality.
